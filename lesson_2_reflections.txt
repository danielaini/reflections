What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates an empty git repository and adds the hidden .git file. You need it to be able to use git (commit, push, pull). 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	It serves as a tool the user can use to decide what to commit. The working directory has all the changes. The repository doesn't have any changes yet. This is where the staging area comes in. It can seperate the changes and apply them to the repository, each logical step at a time. Gives a bit more flexibility to the user.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
